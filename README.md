#Problem Statement:

Breast cancer stands as the most common malignancy afflicting women worldwide, accounting for 30% of all female cancers. 1.5 million women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year, and 500,000 women die from this disease in the world.  While the death rate has reduced over the previous 30 years, this condition has become more prevalent. The challenge lies in the complexity of breast cancer; Unfortunately, The current clinical approach to breast cancer treatment does not sufficiently incorporate the variety of individual patient factors such as menopause, tumor size, and hormone receptor status in decision-making.  Our goal is to transcend these limitations by forging a predictive analytics model that not only understands but anticipates the nuances of each patient's cancer story and gives them the necessary support they need.

As a result, our project aims to:

1. Accurately predict the benignity and malignancy of a given patient given the medical record
   
2. To flag potential cancer recurrences, empowering patients and physicians to steer towards early intervention and preventative care. 

3. Develop a supportive online hub, offering breast cancer resources, patient networking, and guidance to empower informed decision-making and community connection.

4. Spreading awareness about breast cancer and help detect it at an early stage
